# Proposal
An API that allows a user to sign-up, login, and logout; the user will be able to enter their zip code and find the nearest farmer's markets; the users will be able to click a point on the map and see the market's address, number, hours of operations, and possibly a link to directions; The user will also be able to save the location and information to a list (or post of some sort?) to retrieve later.
